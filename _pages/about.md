Hi, my name is Ye Liu. I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at BDSC Lab in University of Illinois at Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Philip S. Yu. My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, like named question answering and commonsense reasoning. 

Prior to that, I received B.S. from Northeastern University, Shenyang, in 2015, and M.S. from University of Illinois at Chicago, in 2016.
