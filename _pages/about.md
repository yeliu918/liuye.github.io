Hi, my name is Ye Liu. I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Philip S. Yu. Prior to that, I received B.S. from Northeastern University, Shenyang, in 2015, and M.S. from University of Illinois at Chicago, in 2016. My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, like named question answering and commonsense reasoning
